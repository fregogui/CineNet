Although he has lived in London his entire life, he is considered one of the most important living Irish playwrights.\n\nMcDonagh prefers writing films to plays, claiming to hold a \"respect for the whole history of films and a slight disrespect for theater.\" In a conversation with Irish drama critic Fintan O'Toole in BOMB Magazine, McDonagh said, \"It's not that I don't respect theater. I'm intelligent enough to know that a play can completely inspire a person as much as a film...[but] theater isn't something that's connected to me, from a personal point of view, I can't appreciate what I'm doing.\"\n\nMcDonagh won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay for his first film, In Bruges.  His second film, Seven Psychopaths, will be released in September 2012.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Martin McDonagh, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

But what's the second-best hangman in England to do on the day they've abolished hanging?  Amongst the cub reporters and pub regulars dying to hear Harry’s reaction to the news, his old assistant Syd (Andy Nyman – Peaky Blinders, Death at a Funeral) and the peculiar Mooney (Johnny Flynn – Clouds of Sils Maria) lurk with very different motives for their visit.",

But even the Jaegers are proving nearly defenseless in the face of the relentless Kaiju. On the verge of defeat, the forces defending mankind have no choice but to turn to two unlikely heroes—a washed-up former pilot (Charlie Hunnam) and an untested trainee (Rinko Kikuchi)—who are teamed to drive a legendary but seemingly obsolete Jaeger from the past. Together, they stand as mankind's last hope against the mounting apocalypse.",

Later, he worked for producers Robert Whitehead and Emanuel Azenberg. Rudin ended up starting his own company after he took a job as a casting agent In lieu of attending college.  In 1980, Rudin moved to Los Angeles, taking up employment at Edgar J. Scherick Associates, where he served as producer on a variety of films including I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can (1981), the NBC miniseries Little Gloria... Happy at Last (1982) and the Oscar-winning documentary He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin' (1983). Rudin later formed his own business, Scott Rudin Productions. His first film under that banner was Gillian Armstrong's Mrs. Soffel (1984). But, not long after, Rudin joined 20th Century-Fox as an executive producer. At Fox, he met Jonathan Dolgen, a higher-level executive, with whom he would be working once again at Paramount Pictures years later. Rudin swiftly rose through the ranks at Fox and became president of production by 1986 at the age of 29. His stint at the top of Fox was short lived though, and he soon left and entered into a producing deal with Paramount.  Rudin lives in New York City with his longtime boyfriend John Barlow, a Broadway theatre publicist and founding partner of Barlow/Hartman Public Relations.",

Spielberg's early science-fiction and adventure films were seen as archetypes of modern Hollywood blockbuster filmmaking. In later years, his films began addressing issues such as the Holocaust, the Transatlantic slave trade, war, and terrorism. He is considered one of the most popular and influential filmmakers in the history of cinema. He is also one of the co-founders of DreamWorks movie studio.\n\nSpielberg won the Academy Award for Best Director for Schindler's List (1993) and Saving Private Ryan (1998). Three of Spielberg's films—Jaws (1975), E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982), and Jurassic Park (1993)—achieved box office records, each becoming the highest-grossing film made at the time. To date, the unadjusted gross of all Spielberg-directed films exceeds $8.5 billion worldwide. Forbes puts Spielberg's wealth at $3.2 billion.",

He has starred in films such as Sid and Nancy, Prick Up Your Ears, JFK, Dracula, True Romance, Léon, The Fifth Element, The Contender, the Harry Potter film series and the Batman film series, as well as in television shows such as Friends and Fallen Angels.\n\nOldman came to prominence in the mid-1980s with a string of performances that prompted pre-eminent film critic, Roger Ebert, to describe him as \"the best young British actor around\". He has been cited as an influence by a number of successful actors. In addition to leading and central supporting roles in big-budget Hollywood films, Oldman has frequently acted in independent films and television shows. Aside from acting, he directed, wrote and co-produced Nil by Mouth, a film partially based on his own childhood, and served as a producer on several films.\n\nAmong other accolades, Oldman has received Emmy-, Screen Actors Guild-, BAFTA- and Independent Spirit Award nominations for his acting work, and has been described as one of the greatest actors never nominated for an Academy Award. His contributions to the science fiction genre have won him a Saturn Award, with a further two nominations. He was also nominated for the 1997 Palme d'Or and won two BAFTA Awards for his filmmaking on Nil By Mouth. In 2011, Empire readers voted Oldman an \"Icon of Film\", in recognition of his contributions to cinema.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Gary Oldman, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.",

To mark this occasion, her bohemian painter son Oswald (Jack Lowden) has returned from Paris. Helene plans to take the opportunity to reveal the truth to Oswald about his father. But the ghosts of the past erupt during an eventful evening, bringing the facade of civilised family life crashing down. Richard Eyre's production of Henrik Ibsen's coruscating masterpiece exploring the malign consequences of buried secrets and lies was universally acclaimed by the critics. It was also nominated for five Olivier Awards. This HD recording was captured at Trafalgar Studios during the play's strictly limited West End season.",

For 17 years, Donald has lived—wildly yet peacefully—in a ramshackle hut near the edge of the forest. When Emily learns his home is the target of developers who will stop at nothing to remove him, saving Donald and his property becomes her personal mission. Despite his gruff exterior and polite refusals for help, Emily is drawn to him—as he is to her—and what begins as a charitable cause evolves into a relationship that will grow even as the bulldozers close in.",

The two form an instantaneous and inseparable bond, and Ayla, almost effortlessly, brings an uncanny joy to the Turkish brigade in the grip of war. As the war comes to a close however, Süleyman's brigade is told that they will be returning home. Süleyman cannot bear abandoning Ayla, and does everything within his power to take her with him. After repeated failure, he is forced to give Ayla to an orphanage, but doesn't give up on the hope of one day reuniting with her. Will the two ever get back together?",

Oh, and a couple of twins (Danielle and Nichole Bird) are thrown into the mix to cause further confusion.  The narrative's series of gags are shot through with sporting references and images of everyday folk taking part in grassroots sports. The swimmers, joggers, cyclists, five-a-side footballers and the rest underline the importance of sport, however casual, to the population in general and the East End of London in particular in this Olympic year.

He was the director of Ice Age: The Meltdown (2006) and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs (2009), and the co-director of Ice Age (2002) and Robots (2005).\n\nSaldanha was born in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. He left his hometown in 1991 to follow his artistic instinct and passion for animation. With a background in computer science and a natural artistic sensibility, he found New York City the perfect locale to merge these skills and become an animator. He attended the MFA program at New York's School of Visual Arts, where he graduated with honors in 1993, after completing two animated shorts, The Adventures of Korky, the Corkscrew (1992) and Time For Love (1993). The shorts have been screened at animation festivals around the world. At SVA, Saldanha met Chris Wedge, one of the cofounders of Blue Sky Studios, who invited him to join their growing team of artists.\n\nHe also worked as animator on Wedge's short film Bunny.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Carlos Saldanha, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.​",
